# Description
  This is a Small Case Study simulating a random walk. 
  We roll the dice 100 times and for each time, if the result is no greater than 2, we step down by 1 step. If the result is between 3 and 5, then we step up by 1 step. If we get result of 6, then we step up by a random number from rolling the dice. Meanwhile, it takes into account of the clumsiness in which case the person is too clumsy to fall down the step. The person start from the 0th step.
  The end result would visualize the step we end up with under the 500 times stimulation. Also, it shows the chances of reaching 60 steps or higher.
